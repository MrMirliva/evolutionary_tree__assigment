# Evolutionary Tree Project

This project constructs and manipulates an evolutionary tree using data from CSV files. The tree structure is built from nodes and links provided in the dataset.

## Requirements

- Java 21 or higher

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    https://github.com/MrMirliva/tree_of_life_assigment.git
    cd evolutionary-tree
    ```

2. **Compile the project:**
    ```sh
    javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/Main.java
    ```

3. **Run the project:**
    ```sh
    java -cp bin Main
    ```

## Project Structure

- [dataSets]: Contains the CSV files with nodes and links data.
- [dataStructers]: Contains the tree data structure implementations.
- [models]: Contains the data models used in the project.
- [outputs]: Contains the output files generated by the project.
- [Main.java]: The main entry point of the project.

## Handling File Reading Errors

If you encounter file reading errors, ensure the following:

1. **File Paths:**
   - Verify that the paths to the CSV files are correct.
   - Check lines 31, 32, and 33 in the `Main` class for file paths.
   - Ensure the file paths are correct for your operating system:
     - **Linux/MacOS:** Use forward slashes (`/`) in the file paths.
     - **Windows:** Use double backslashes (`\\`) in the file paths.

    ```java
    // File Paths
    static String linksPath = "dataSets/treeoflife_links.csv";
    static String nodesPath = "dataSets/treeoflife_nodes.csv";
    static String outputPath = "outputs/pre_order.txt";
    ```

   - Ensure the files are not empty and are formatted correctly.

2. **Permissions:**
   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read the files.

3. **Error Messages:**
   - If a [FileNotFoundException] occurs, check if the file exists at the specified path.
   - If an [IOException] occurs, ensure the file is not being used by another process and is accessible.
